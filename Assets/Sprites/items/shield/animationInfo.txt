You may use one of the sprites if you want a static image for the item (preferibly "sh01")
otherwise, the intended animation sequence is as follows:

sh01
sh02
sh03
sh04
sh03
sh02

loop

This should create a spinning animation for this sprite. There is also 
a bouncy up/down animation for this sprite as well
