You may use one of the sprites if you want a static image for the item (preferibly "life01")
otherwise, the intended animation sequence is as follows:

life01
life02
life03
life04
life05
life06
life07
life06
life05
life04
life03
life02

loop

This should create a spinning animation for this sprite

this sprite will only be highly visible if the background is dark
